        == Summary
        
        Welcome to the sapnwrfc Python module.
        This module is intended to facilitate RFC calls to an SAP R/3
        system of release 4.6x and above.
        It may work for earlier versions but it hasn't been tested.
        The fundamental purpose of the production of this package, is
        to provide a clean object oriented interface to RFC calls from
        within Python.  This will hopefully have a number of effects:
        (1) make it really easy to do RFC calls to SAP from Python in
        an object oriented fashion (Doh!)
        (2) promote Python as the interface/scripting/glue language of
        choice for interaction with SAP R/3.
        (3) make the combination of Linux, Apache, and Python the killer
        app for internet connectivity with SAP.
        (4) Establish a small fun open source project that people are
        more than welcome to contribute to, if they so wish.
